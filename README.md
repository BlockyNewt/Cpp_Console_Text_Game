# C-_Console_Text_Game

This is a game I made a while back. Feel free to look at the code and use it.    

A few errors to know if you are going to play it. 
1.)Highest map you can go to is "Cave" 
2.)Typing anything other than an int on the main menu screen will cause you an error 
3.)Loading a game without a save file will cause errors in the stat menu do to not initializing anything  

I knew about these errors and a few others I can't think off the top of my head right now. I could have fixed them but just didn't get around to doing so. 
If you are going to read over the source code and want to tell me a few errors you realized or something I could have done better code wise, 
I'm all down for hearing it.
